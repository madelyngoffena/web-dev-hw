<h1>“Alone”</h1>
<h2>By Edgar Allan Poe<h2>
<hr />
<p>From childhood’s hour I have not been<br />
As others were—I have not seen<br />
As others saw—I could not bring<br />
My passions from a common spring—<br />
From the same source I have not taken<br />
My sorrow—I could not awaken<br />
My heart to joy at the same tone—<br />
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br />
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br />
Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br />
From ev’ry depth of good and ill<br />
The mystery which binds me still—<br />
From the torrent, or the fountain—<br />
From the red cliff of the mountain—<br />
From the sun that ’round me roll’d<br />
In its autumn tint of gold—<br />
From the lightning in the sky<br />
As it pass’d me flying by—<br />
From the thunder, and the storm—<br />
And the cloud that took the form<br />
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br />
Of a demon in my view—</p>
