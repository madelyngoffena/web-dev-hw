             </p>
             If one and all who hear my call<br>
             Could lend their ears to me<br>
             Then you could hear the crooked tale<br>
             Of how this fire has come to be<br>
             <br>
             I must admit that the manipulator's fate<br>
             was resting at my feet<br>
             But all of his intimidation brought me to my knees when he said<br>
             <br>
             "Keep this secret safe, or watch your flock devoured by the flame<br>
             Left in my wake; I'll burn through you."<br>
             <br>
             There is a vision you have come to know and love<br>
             (the deft defender with a heart of gold)<br>
             An imitation of a man he left to die<br>
             Face down in the mud<br>
             (such venom coursing through his veins)<br>
             <br>
             And now the mimic is a cynic who laughs<br>
             While the house of God is reduced to ash<br>
             Well, I won't let corruption carry on<br>
             <br>
             Come out from the dark and claim your life<br>
             Before you all but fall apart<br>
             We can keep this wolf far from our flock<br>
             So raise your voices, torches, rocks<br>
             And follow me into the night<br>
             We'll bring this evil to the light<br>
             <br>
             You tried to take control<br>
             But you couldn't with a stolen soul<br>
             So we're coming after you tonight<br>
             Coming after you tonight<br>
             No word he could uphold<br>
             Cause the only truth he ever told<br>
             Was that there's far too many ways to die<br>
             Far too many ways to die<br>
             <br>
             Lost in his memories; the end in sight<br>
             <br>
             Come out from the dark and claim your life<br>
             Before you all but fall apart<br>
             We can keep this wolf far from our flock<br>
             So raise your voices, torches, rocks<br>
             And follow me into the night<br>
             We'll bring this evil to the light<br>
