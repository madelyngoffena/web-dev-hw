    <br>   Mama, what if I carried our eggs <br>
Our ptarmigan eggs!<br>
and I tried to be careful,<br>
and I tried to walk slowly, <br>
But I fell <br>
and the eggs broke? <br>
<i>Then I would be sorry. <br>
But still, <strong>I would love you.</strong></i>

       <div class="4" id="page-4">
What if I put salmon in your parka, <br>
Ermine in your mittens, <br>
and lemmings in your mukluks?<br>
<i>Then I would be angry.</i><br>
</div>
<div class="5" id="page-5">
<i>What if I threw water at our lamp? <br>
Then, Dear One, <br>
I would be very angry. <br>
But still, <strong>I would love you.</strong></i> <br>
</div>
<div class="6" id="page-6">
<br>What if I ran away? <br>
<i>Then I would be worried.</i> <br>
What if I stayed away <br>
and sang with the wolves <br>
and slept in a cave?<br>
<i>Then, Dear One,<br>
I would be very sad.<br>
But still, <strong>I would love you.</strong></i><br>
