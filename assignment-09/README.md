####Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selector is used to style all the element on a page were an element selector is used to select one type of element. Class selectors select elements that do the same thing. ID selector is similar to class selectors because the ID selector lets us make style rules for an element by calling its unique ID.

####Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I used all bright colors because the 80s were very bright and obnoxious.

I am kinda confused on what the style.css is used for but overall I had a fun time playing with color.
