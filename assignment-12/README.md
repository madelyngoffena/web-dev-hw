####Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client was a soap maker how wanted to sell soaps and teach people how to make their own soap. I made the site soft and inviting to not take away from their soap designs.  

####What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Display: inline forces the element in a horizontal line. Display: inline-block removes new lines in block elements. Display: block blocks elements into inline or inline-block elements or to turn inline elements into block elements.
