####What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

Border help define how much space an element or box takes up and its relationship with other boxes. Borders defining feature is that the border is a part of the box and can be separately styled.  Padding is the amount of space between the inner element and the element itself. Margin is the box element and other elements.
