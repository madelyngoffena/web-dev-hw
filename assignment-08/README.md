#Assignment 8-
####Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

It was a little difficult due to my dyslexia but it was fun to learn but plugging in the code and learning what makes it function.

####Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am always exicted to learn I am just worried my HTML isn't put together well enough to make it work.

####Free Response:

I followed the instuctions very closely it would be nice to have the little links to each element given it would cut down my work time a bit because I like to make sure I have each one right. I look for each code needed in the modules which takes some time.
