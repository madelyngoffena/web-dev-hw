More than the dog loves his tail,<br>
More than the whale loves his spout.</i><br>
  <br> </div>
   <div class="1" id="page-2">
    <br> <b>How long?</b><br>

Our ptarmigan eggs!<br>
and I tried to be careful,<br>

and the eggs broke?</b> <br>
<i>Then I would be sorry. <br>
But still, <strong>I would love you.</strong></i>

<br><b>What if I ran away?</b> <br>

I would be very sad.<br>
But still, <strong>I would love you.</strong></i><br>
