I looked at tumblr because I use that often and in 2007 when it came out it looked horrible compared to what it looks like now. Its logo was a bright blue flower and the whole page was mostly white compared to its now iconic dark blue-green background with white lettering. The flower idea was scrapped and is no longer with the text. It may be because I am so custom to what it looks like now but I think it is much better now.  

I didn't understand because something went wrong so I just used Atom to do the coding it is simpler and easier to navigate.
